# redshift_grant (Resource)

Defines access privileges for users and  groups. Privileges include access options such as being able to read data in tables and views, write data, create tables, and drop tables. Use this command to give specific privileges for a table, database, datashare_database, schema, function, procedure, language, or column.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "redshift_grant" "user" {
  user        = "john"
  schema      = "my_schema"
  object_type = "schema"
  privileges  = ["create", "usage"]
}

resource "redshift_grant" "group" {
  group       = "analysts"
  schema      = "my_schema"
  object_type = "schema"
  privileges  = ["usage"]
}

# Granting permissions to execute functions or procedures requires providing their arguments' types

resource "redshift_grant" "user" {
  user        = "john"
  schema      = "my_schema"
  object_type = "function"
  objects     = ["my_function(float)"]
  privileges  = ["execute"]
}

resource "redshift_grant" "datashare_database" {
  group       = "analysts"
  object_type = "datashare_database"
  objects     = ["analysts_datashare_database"]
  privileges  = ["usage"]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- **object_type** (String) The Redshift object type to grant privileges on (one of: table, schema, database, datashare_database, function, procedure, language).
- **privileges** (Set of String) The list of privileges to apply as default privileges. See [GRANT command documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_GRANT.html) to see what privileges are available to which object type. An empty list could be provided to revoke all privileges for this user or group. Required when `object_type` is set to `language`.

### Optional

- **group** (String) The name of the group to grant privileges on. Either `group` or `user` parameter must be set.
- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **objects** (Set of String) The objects upon which to grant the privileges. An empty list (the default) means to grant permissions on all objects of the specified type. Ignored when `object_type` is one of (`schema`).  There is a current limitation that if `object_type` is one of (`database`,`datashare_database`), the list can only have a single element, i.e. as a part of one resource, grants for only one `database` or `datashare_database` can be created. If you want to add grants for multiple, you can create them in separate resources
- **schema** (String) The database schema to grant privileges on.
- **user** (String) The name of the user to grant privileges on. Either `user` or `group` parameter must be set.
